## Backend repository
- Nestjs is by far my favorite framework for node js and backend. I love this technology because it allows me to do modular programming and create very scalable applications on the backend side. 
- For data persistence the project uses PostgreSQL. TypeORM is being used for nestJS queries to the database.
